			<h2>You can drive 90 minutes from New York City and feel as though you’ve never left. Same restaurants, same people, same conversations, same outfits. And then you can drive 90 minutes from Manhattan and feel like you’re in a different country: dense woods, streams running alongside unpaved roads, warnings tacked to telephone poles cautioning deer hunters against trespassing. There might be a few gourmet markets and inns with minimalist, sans serif signs, but on the January day I visit Gigi Hadid in rural Pennsylvania, the only notable landmark I see anywhere near her home is a humble gas station.</h2>

			<h2>High over New York City, Demi Moore leans against the rail of a penthouse pool, her eyes half-closed against the dying sun. She is wearing a meltdown gown—an hourglass halter in blood-red silk-satin—that cascades over her feet in a liquid train. It's a very deliberately sexy dress, a vamp dress. And when she's in pose, with head flung imperiously back and white neck and arms outstretched, she stops everyone's breath. She looks luminous, powerful; she looks like Madame X in the Sargent painting; she looks like Rita Hayworth singing “Put the Blame on Mame.” Mario Testino growls, “Gorr-geous, Demi! Like that, like that. Gorr-geous! Like that! Gorrrr! Jess!”</h2>

				<li><a>Before Vintage Was Everywhere</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>For clothes, going out of date used to be an irreversible process. The clothes Mother wore became increasingly ridiculous until, eventually, they might achieve a nice condition called "quaintness." You could look fine if you were quaintly dressed—but only if you were on the stage, or at a costume party, or if you were a comic, elderly, or royal personage, or a child. But "quaintness" is now obsolete. Instead, we have la mode rétro, expressed not only by deft reproductions of lately outmoded fashions but by a passion for the old stuff itself. Why do we have this passion, and where did we get it?</h2>

				<li><a>The Best Dressed Stars of the Week Stylishly Stepped Into Spring</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Spring has officially sprung! While that may be sad news for lovers of winter outerwear and layering, Hollywood A-listers are already embracing the new season on the red carpets. The best dressed stars of the week were those who slipped into colorful and lightweight silhouettes that are stylishly ready for warmer weather. This included everything from gauzy and sheer dresses, to sharp tailoring and suits.</h2>
